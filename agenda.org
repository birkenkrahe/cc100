* README

  This file contains the agenda overview (what I had planned), the
  objectives (what we managed to do) and (much of the) content of each
  taught session of the course. I want to avoid splitting the content
  up over many files - so that you have to navigate as little as
  possible (like a book)!

  The companion file to this file, less structured and with the
  captain's log, is the [[./notes.org][notes.org]] file.

* Welcome to the course - w1s1 (01/12/22)

** Objectives


   * [X] Understand printing formats

   * [X] Write a program with variable declarations and assignments

* Test review - w6s12 (02/14/22)
** Objectives

   * [X] Understand test results
   * [X] Know what to do different next time
   * [X] Discuss selected questions and answers

** Test results - stats and plots

   * The results are nothing to write home about - though > 50% means
     that the class passed (on average).
     #+caption: Test 1 results (Schoology)
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     [[./img/test_1_stats.png]]

   * I am an obsessive fact-checker. When checking the stats with R, I
     find slightly different results:
     #+name: test 1 results
     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
       results <- c(8.07,9.5,9.66,10.21,12.12,12.66,14,14.1,
                    14.75,14.75,14.97,15,15.75,17,19,19.36)
       sd(results)
       summary(results)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: test 1 results
     :
     : [1] 3.288485
     :
     :    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
     :    8.07   11.64   14.43   13.81   15.19   19.36

   * Let's make some plots: histogram, boxplot and density plot. I'dd
     like the histogram and the density plot (a smoothened histogram)
     to peak more to the right, and for the boxplot to be smaller and
     higher up.
     #+name: histogram
     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ./img/test1hist.png
       hist(results, main="Histogram of test 1 results, CSC 100 Spring 2022")
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: histogram
     [[file:./img/test1hist.png]]

     #+name: boxplot
     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ./img/test1box.png
       boxplot(results, main="Test 1 results, CSC 100 Spring 2022")
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: boxplot
     [[file:./img/test1box.png]]

     #+name: density
     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ./img/test1density.png
       ave <- mean(results)
       d <- density(results)
       plot(d, col="steelblue",main="Test 1 Results CSC 100 Spring 2022")
       abline(v=ave,col="red")
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: density
     [[file:./img/test1density.png]]

** Analysis - feedback and action points

   * Test 1 can now be played an unlimited number of times. I have
     added feedback to all new questions.

   * There will not be another paper-based test: the results weren't
     much better than in other courses, and test preparation and
     grading are excruciating if partial credit is given.

   * What surprised me most was that many of you did not use the
     available time.

   * See also: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/diary.org#i-can-teach-it-to-you-but-i-cannot-learn-it-for-you]["I can teach it to you but I cannot learn it for you"]]

   * Questions:
     - How did you study for this test?
     - If you didn't perform well, what will you change?
     - What can I do to help you help yourself?

   * CHANGES TO BE APPLIED BY BIRKENKRAHE (FUTURE QUIZ/TESTS):
     - Fewer choices for the multiple choice
     - Announce if a question has > 1 answer (and how many)

   #+caption: Feynman (via Twitter)
   #+attr_html: :width 500px
   [[./img/feynman.png]]

   * Post-mortem on a couple of questions
     - comment format (last question)
     - ~printf~ format
   #+name: noppeprogram
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes stdio.h
     /*     one line
      ,*     multi line
      ,*/
     float f = 4.0f;
     printf("hello %.pf", f);
     /* one line
        or multi line
     ,*/
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS: noppeprogram
   : hello 00000000f

   * Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a
     10-meter radius, using the formula $v=4/3\times\pi r^{3}$.
   * Write the fraction $4/3$ as ~4.0f/3.0f~. (Try writing it as 4/3
     and see what happens.)
   * Remember that C does not have an exponentiation operator, so you
     need to write $r^{3}$ as ~r*r*r~.
   * Upload your solution program as a ~.c~ file or as a ~.org~ file
     to Schoology not later than 11 AM on Monday, February 21st. Make
     sure that your program actually runs without errors!
   * Be prepared to present your solution in class.

* Formatting, C constants - w6s13 (02/16/22)
** Objectives

   * [X] Review: be the compiler / function challenge
   * [X] Understand different ways of defining C constants
   * [ ] Practice constant definitions
   * [ ] Understand naming conventions for C programs

** Warming up: be the compiler!

   The output of the program below should be:
   #+begin_example
     : The tax on 200.00 is 35.00, so the grandtotal is 235.00.
   #+end_example
   but instead the output is
   #+begin_example
     : The tax on -1093221452 is 0, so the grandtotal is 1080623104.
   #+end_example
   Can you fix the program [[tax]]?.

   #+name: tax
   #+begin_src C :results output :flags -Wall
     float subtotal;
     int tax;
     float grandtotal;
     float taxrate;

     taxrate = 0.175;
     subtotal = 200;
     tax = subtotal * taxrate;
     grandtotal = subtotal + tax;

     printf("The tax on %d is %d, so the grandtotal is %d\n",
            subtotal, tax, grandtotal);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS: tax
   : The tax on 0 is 1080623104, so the grandtotal is 34

** Programming challenge: hello world function

   * Things to remember:
     - You need to declare stuff before you can use it in C.
     - The function definition looks just like ~main~

   * Challenge: Write a function ~hello()~ that prints out ~hello
     world~ when called.

   * You can do this in Emacs in one code block, which contains the
     definition and the function call.

   * This challenge carries extra credit! Submit Org-file via
     email.

   * Solution next week! (This implies that you send it to me before
     the first class next week.)

* C constants, naming - w6s15 (02/18/22)
** News

   * Invitation for an online data science seminar with the data
     scientist of Stone Ward, Little Rock/Chicago, Matthew Ward: join
     us at 3 pm via Google Meet (see Schoology) - incl INTERNSHIPS

   * Great tips for getting better with Emacs quickly [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/splayn/how_to_start_learning_emacs_my_successful_method/][in this post]].
     See also my [[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgb17bzeNygo8GU6SivwwjsQj9QabqAJ][Emacs for Beginners YouTube playlist]].
     #+begin_quote
     I started as a rank newbie 14 days ago, and I've learned enough
     to "get started", kind of grok emacs beginner fundamentals and
     simple navigation, and I feel VERY good about my progress. I
     wanted to share how I got to this point. (Note that I happened to
     have the time to read/watch/practice a few hours a day. If I only
     had 30 min per day, it would have taken me a month or two to get
     to this level.)

     #+name: 022122_err
     #+begin_src C
       float int1=1.f, int2=2.f, int;
       printf("%.2f\n"; int = int 1 + int 2);
     #+end_src

   * SOLUTION: see class notes.

** How do class assignments work?

   * In-class assignments are *10%* of your total grade
   * They are labeled *class assignments* in the Schoology gradebook
   * You get the points if you attend and participate *actively*
   * If you check your phone instead, you're *not* active
   * If you could not attend, submit *late*

** [[file:~/Documents/GitHub/admin/spring22/cc100/org/assignments.org::Volume][Programming assignment review]]

   * I left detailed comments for most of you: use them or ask me! Use
     them by modifying your submission accordingly.

   * You can find examples and solutions in the class notes later.

   * Future submissions will be graded not just for effort but for
     accuracy (this includes following the instructions). However, you
     can (and should) always re-submit an improved version.

   * Computer science is a craft like any other: (1) you keep at it
     until you got it right, (2) you don't give up easily, and (3) you
     ask for help when you're at the end of your wits.

   * Please submit an Org-mode file if you have one so that I don't
     have to check your results line-by-line but can just run it.

   * Org-mode meta data were often not correct (file will still run)
     #+begin_example
     #+AUTHOR: name

     #+name: code
     #+begin_src C
     ...
     #+end_src
     #+end_example

   * A couple of programs looked awfully similar (down to errors):
     - There is no need to bend the rules: this is not a rat race!
     - If in doubt about "what is cheating", [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc100/blob/main/syllabus.org#assignments-and-honor-codefn2][check the syllabus]].
     - Add ~#+HONOR: pledged~ to the top of your Org-mode submissions

   * You can find online REPLs (Read-Eval-Print-Loops) [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php][like this one]]
     to try things out if you're flummoxed by Emacs Org-mode (at this
     point, you shouldn't be but Windows can be toxic...)

   * User-defined functions are where programming really begins

   * See class notes for challenge solution

* Reading input with Emacs, tangling code - w7s17 (02/23/22)
** Objectives

   * [X] New programming exercise "phone number conversion"
   * [X] How to use ~scanf~ inside Emacs (and other input)
   * [X] Understand reading input (from the command line)

** How to use ~scanf~ inside Emacs with redirection

   * Emacs can fetch arguments via the header arguments ~:cmdline~ (as
     input redirected from a file), or via ~:var~ through assignment.
     #+name: cmdline
     #+begin_src C :cmdline < input :tangle practice/cmd.c
       float i,j;
       scanf("%f %f\n",&i, &j);
       printf("input was: %f %f\n",i,j);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: cmdline
     : input was: 1.000000 2.000000

   * [X] If your neighbor does not get along, help him/her without
     being asked explicitly! (Well done everyone!)

   * [X] Create a file called ~input~ in the current working
     directory. It contains only the numbers ~1.~ and ~2.~:
     #+begin_example
       1. 2.
     #+end_example

   * [X] Create and run the code block [[cmdline]] in Emacs in a Org-mode
     file. Make sure that you have ~:main yes~ and ~:include
     <stdio.h>~ either on the code block header line or in the
     ~#+PROPERTY:~ meta data of your Emacs Org-mode file.

   * [X] Create and run the code block [[cmdline]] in Emacs. Make
     sure that you have ~:main yes~ and ~:include <stdio.h>~ either on
     the code block header line or in the ~#+PROPERTY:~ meta data of
     your Emacs Org-mode file.

   * [X] Tangle the code block and look at the file ~cmd.c~. To
     tangle, use the key sequence ~C-c C-v t~.

   * [X] Open a CMD terminal (or ~M-x shell~ inside Emacs), and
     compile the program ~cmd.c~. Call the executable ~cmd~.

   * [X] Run the program on the command line like this:
     #+begin_example
     cmd < input
     #+end_example

   * Shell "redirection" (directing the content of ~input~ into ~cmd~)
     is an important shell process. It uses both ~stdin~ and
     ~stdout~. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html][See GNU bash manual for details]].

** [[file:~/Documents/GitHub/admin/spring22/cc100/org/assignments.org::Phone number conversion][Programming assignment]] (until +Monday, 28-Feb+ Tuesday, 1-Mar, 11 AM)

   * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a telephone number
     in the form ~(xxx) xxx-xxxx~, and then displays the number in the
     form ~xxx.xxx.xxxx~.

   * Example input/output of the first program, ~phone1.c~:
     #+begin_example
     Enter phone number [(xxx) xxx-xxxx]: (870) 456-7890
     You entered 870.456.7890
     #+end_example

   * Write another program that asks for the input format in the form
     ~xxx\xxx\xxxx~, and then displays the number in the form
     ~(xxx)xxx-xxx~.

   * Example input/output of the second program, ~phone2.c~:
     #+begin_example
     Enter phone number [xxx\xxx\xxxx]: 870\456\7890
     You entered (870) 456-7890
     #+end_example

   * Submit one Emacs Org-mode file ~phone.org~ with both programs in
     it as code blocks that can be *tangled* as ~phone1.c~ and
     ~phone2.c~, resp.

   * The header information of your Org-mode file should look like this:
     #+begin_example
       #+TITLE: Phone number conversion
       #+AUTHOR: [your name]
       #+HONOR: pledged
     #+end_example

   * Tip: some characters, like ~\~ are protected because they are
     part of the file ~PATH~. If you want to use them, you have to
     "escape" them with an extra ~\~, like the newline character
     ~\n~. So to print or to scan the character ~\~, you use ~\\~.
     #+name: escape
     #+begin_src C :results output
       printf("hi there\n");              // string output
       printf(" \"hi there\" \n");        // escaped \" will print
       printf("This is a slash: \ \n");   // slash will not print
       printf("This is a slash: \\ \n");  // escaped slash\\  will print
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: escape
     : hi there
     :  "hi there"
     : This is a slash:
     : This is a slash: \

** Compile and run C in the shell

   * [ ] Create a minimum C file, e.g. a hello world program ~hw.c~- either
     in Emacs or in any other editor you like:
     #+name: helloworld
     #+begin_src C :tangle practice/hw.c
       #include <stdio.h>

       int main() {
         puts("hello world");
       }
     #+end_src

   * [ ] Open a terminal (or ~M-x shell~ or ~M-x eshell~ in Emacs).

   * [ ] Convince yourself that the file can be found with ~DIR hw.c~

   * [ ] Compile the file with ~gcc -o hello hw.c~

   * [ ] The ~-o hello~ means "name the executable ~hello~"

   * [ ] Run the file by entering the name of the executable

   * [ ] As you can see via ~dir hello*~, the executable is actually
     called ~hello.exe~ in Windows.

** 2 Tips for the programming assignment

   1) (02/25/2022) If you want to test and run your file *inside*
      Emacs, which saves a lot of time, just add this to the header
      arguments (after the ~C~):
      #+begin_example
        :cmdline < input
      #+end_example
      where ~input~ is a file that contains the phone number as
      requested for input, ~(xxx) xxx-xxxx~ or ~xxx\xxx\xxxx~. Now
      ~C-c C-c~ will run and execute the program. Alternatively, you
      have to tangle the code block, compile and run it by hand on
      the command line.

   2) (02/27/2022) the formatting in ~scanf()~ needs to match the input
      pattern. E.g. if the input is given as
      #+begin_example
        foo==++//bar
      #+end_example
      (with ~foo~ and ~bar~ decleared as ~int~ variables) then only
      the following command will pick the input up properly:
      #+begin_example
        scanf("%d==++//%d", &foo, &bar);
      #+end_example
      irrespective of the output, which can be formatted in any way
      we like. ~scanf()~ only looks for two integers separated by all
      that junk between the numbers.

      Example: the file ~inputfile~ contains only: ~444==++//555~. We
      want to only print out ~444~ and ~555~.
      #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :cmdline < practice/inputfile
        int a,b;
        scanf("%d==++//%d", &a, &b);
        printf("%d %d", a,  b);
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : 444 555

** Improve your grade with a project

   If you want to improve your grade, you can talk to me about doing
   a small, independent research project leading to a writeup in the
   form of a notebook, or a short (10-15 min) presentation. The topic
   must be related to the topic of this course.

** Objectives

   * [X] Understand how to compile and run C in the shell
   * [X] Understand literate programming once and for all
   * [ ] Understand what good program layout means (practice)

** Compile and run C in the shell

   * Three shells are at your disposal: Microsoft shell (MacOS
     terminal), Emacs eshell, Emacs shell (= terminal) = CMD line

   * Files you run in the terminal: Windows ~*.exe~ files - executable
     in binary format = machine code
     
   * [X] Create a minimum C file, e.g. a hello world program ~hw.c~-
     either in Emacs or in any other editor you like:

     #+name: helloworld
     #+begin_src C :tangle practice/hw.c
       #include <stdio.h>

       int main() {
         puts("hello world");
       }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: helloworld
     : hello world

   * [X] Tangle the code block above with ~C-c C-v t~ (if you have
     more than one code block in an Org file, use ~C-u C-c C-v t~)

   * [X] Open a terminal (or ~M-x shell~ or ~M-x eshell~ in Emacs).

   * [X] Convince yourself that the file can be found with ~DIR hw.c~

   * [X] Compile the file with ~gcc -o hello hw.c~

   * [X] The ~-o hello~ means "name the executable ~hello~"

   * [X] Run the file by entering the name of the executable

   * [X] As you can see via ~dir hello*~, the executable is actually
     called ~hello.exe~ in Windows.

[fn:3]GNU Emacs is an extensible text editor. Org-mode is a plain text
environment in GNU Emacs for keeping notes, authoring documents,
computational notebooks, and more. Tangling code means extracting
(human readable) source code from an Org-mode file in order to run
it. Weaving documentation means extracting a document from an Org-mode
file in order to read it.

[fn:2]I managed to install GCC on the lab computers and run it inside
GNU Emacs. This is something that you should do at home with your own
computer. I'm going to demonstrate the process in class and I will
also make a short video showing how to do it (for Windows 10).

[fn:1]This requires system admin privileges, which you only have on
your own PC. In the computer lab, I have such principles, and as soon
as I managed to install our tools, you can also use them on the lab
equipment.
