* README

  * This script introduces C pointers in theory and practice.

  * Practice workbooks and input files [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12FZkGSRdzfxFd1-QEMxMkw0Q-Alz4F3U?usp=sharing][in GDrive]].

  * PDF version of this file and of the completed practice workbooks
    is available [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc100/tree/main/pdf][in GitHub]].

  * This section, including some sample code, is based on: chapter 11
    in King (2008), and chapter 7 in Davenport/Vine.

* Overview

  * Computer memory is like a list of /locations/

  * Each chunk of memory has an /address/ to a location

  * /Pointers/ point to these addresses

  * The /address/ is not the house, it's a /reference/

  * C#, Java, Pascal, Python...do not offer pointers (easily)[fn:1]

  * C and C++ offer pointer variables and operators naturally

  * This gives you a lot more control over the computer

  * Examples:
    - *String manipulation* (working with text - e.g. when creating
    fast-performing chat bots or AI agents)
    - *Dynamic memory allocation* - the process of assigning memory
      during the execution time (when a program typically competes
      with thousands of other processes)

  * It's mind control: You can essentially decide what the computer
    should think with which part of its "brain" (great potential to
    mess up, too), e.g. when you mis-allocate resources.

* Indirection (concept)

  * Imagine you have a /variable/ ~iResult~ that contains the /value/ ~75~.

  * The variable is /located/ at a memory address ~0061FEC8~.

  * Imagine you have a /pointer variable/ ~myPointer~ that contains the
    address ~0061FEC8~ of the variable ~iResult~.

  * This means that ~myPointer~ /indirectly/ points to the value ~75~.

  * You already worked with pointers: an /array name/ ~a~ is a pointer to
    the start of the array, the address of ~a[0]~.

    #+begin_src C
      int a[2] = {0,1};
      printf("a[0]=%d\na[1]=%d\n&a=%d\n", a[0], a[1], &a);
    #+end_src

  * You already worked with pointers: arguments in the call of ~scanf~~
    are /pointers/: without the ~&~, the function would be supplied with
    the /value/ of ~i~, not the /address/.

    #+begin_example C
    int i;
    scanf("%d", &i);
    #+end_example

* Indirection (code)

  * There are two /unary/ pointer operators:
    - the /address/ (or referencing) operator ~&~
    - the /indirection/ (or dereferencing) operator ~*~

  * The unary /address/ operator ~&~ returns a computer memory address,
    e.g. ~&iResult = 6422216~ - it /references/ the memory location

  * The unary /indirection/ operator ~*~ returns a value, e.g. ~*myPointer
    = 75~ if ~myPointer~ points at ~&iResult~. T

    #+begin_src C
      int iResult; // declare an integer variable
      iResult = 75; // iResult now has the value 75

      int *myPointer; // declare an integer pointer variable
      myPointer = &iResult; // myPointer points at iResult's address

      printf("iResult = %d and lives at &iResult = %p\n",
             iResult, &iResult);

      printf("myPointer = %p points to iResult = %d\n",
             myPointer, *myPointer);
    #+end_src

* ~*~ and ~&~ are inverse to one another

  * Adress and indirection operator are /inverse/ to one another
    (i.e. they reverse each other's operation - applying both amounts
    to doing nothing).

    #+begin_src C
      int iResult = 75, *myPointer = &iResult; // declaring and initializing

      // print variable and dereferenced pointer
      printf("iResult=%d => *&iResult=%d\n",
             iResult, *&iResult);
      // print pointer and address of pointer
      printf("myPointer=%p => &*myPointer=%p\n",
             myPointer, &*myPointer);
    #+end_src

  * Applying ~&~ to a variable produces a pointer to the variable

  * Applying ~*~ to the pointer takes us back to the original variable

    #+begin_example C
      j = *&i  // same as j = i
    #+end_example

* Pointers  must be initialized

  * Not initialized pointers lead to invalid data or expressions.

  * Pointer variables should always be initialized with:
    - another variable's memory address (e.g. ~&i~), or
    - with 0, or
    - with the keyword ~NULL~.

  * Here are some /valid/ pointer initializations - ~printf~ uses the
    format specifier ~%p~ for pointers.

    #+begin_src C
      int *ptr1;  // declarations
      int *ptr2;
      int *ptr3;
      double x = 3.14; // initialize variable

      ptr1 = &x; // initialize with address
      ptr2 = 0;  // initialize with 0
      ptr3 = NULL; // initialize with NULL

      printf("%p %p %p\n", ptr1, ptr2, ptr3);
    #+end_src

  * [ ] Here are a few non-valid initializations:
    - can you tell why?
    - can you right the wrongs?

    #+begin_src C :results silent
      int i = 5; // declare and initialize i
      int *iPtr; // declare pointer iPtr

      iPtr = i;   // wrong because...
      iPtr = 7;   // wrong because...
    #+end_src

  * Solution:
    
    #+begin_src C :results output
      int i = 5; // 
      int *iPtr;

      iPtr = &i;   // pointer initialized with memory address
      *iPtr = 7;   // value of i indirectly changed

      printf("%p %p %d\n", iPtr, &i, i);
    #+end_src

* Let's practice!

[fn:1] Python e.g. is actually written in C - its default
implementation is called [[https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide/#part-1-introduction-to-cpython][CPython]]. However, in Python, usability was
favored over machine performance, so pointers are not implemented at
the user level. C underlies most of the much-used modern programming
languages and their (internal) memory management.
