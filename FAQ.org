* Setting the path to GCC for Emacs in ~.emacs~

  If you cannot set the path to the GCC compiler using the ~PATH~
  variable (e.g. when you work on a computer in the lab where you
  don't have administrative privileges), you can give the explicit
  location of the compiler by setting the variable
  ~Org-babel-C-compiler~.

  #+name gcc path
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; set the path to GCC for Org-mode Babel
    (setq org-babel-C-compiler "\"c:/Program Files (x86)/mingw-w64/i686-8.1.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v6-rev0/mingw32/bin/gcc.exe\"")
  #+end_src

  Unlike other Babel-language extensions, this Babel package is
  "customizable". This means that there is a menu do set the
  variable. You find this out by looking for the variable with the
  command: ~C-h v org-babel-c-compiler RET~. It returns the current
  value of the variable and a link to the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html][Easy Customization
  Interface]].

* Should we get the first or the second edition of the textbook by King?

  The second edition (King, 2008).

* When registering with GitHub...
** ...what if we cannot get verified (as a human)?

   Well, are you sure what you are? Seriously though, just try another captcha.
** ...what should we put as special interest?

   It does not matter. Anything.
