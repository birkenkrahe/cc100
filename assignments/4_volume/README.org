   * Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a
     10-meter radius, using the formula $v=4/3\times\pi r^{3}$.
   * Write the fraction $4/3$ as ~4.0f/3.0f~. (Try writing it as 4/3
     and see what happens.)
   * Remember that C does not have an exponentiation operator, so you
     need to write $r^{3}$ as ~r*r*r~.
   * Upload your solution program as a ~.c~ file or as a ~.org~ file
     to Schoology not later than 11 AM on Monday, February 21st. Make
     sure that your program actually runs without errors!
   * Be prepared to present your solution in class.
