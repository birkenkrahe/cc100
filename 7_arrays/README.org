* README

  * This script introduces C arrays.

  * Practice workbooks and input files [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12FZkGSRdzfxFd1-QEMxMkw0Q-Alz4F3U?usp=sharing][in GDrive]]

  * PDF version of this file and of the completed practice workbooks
    is available [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc100/tree/main/pdf][in GitHub]].

  * This section, including some sample code, is based on chapter 6 in
    Davenport/Vine (2015) and chapter 8 in King (2008).

* Overview

  * Variables that can hold only a single data item (a number or a
    character, which is a number, too) are called *scalars*

  * In mathematics, ordered tuples of data are called *vectors*[fn:1]:

    #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
      v <- c(1,2,3)  ## create a vector of three numbers
      print(v)
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : [1] 1 2 3

  * In C there are two *aggregate* stuctures that can store collections
    of values: *arrays* and *structures*.

  * *structures* are the forerunners of classes, a concept that becomes
    central in C++ ([[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_structures.htm][more on structures]]).

** What is an array?

   * An *array* is a /data structure/ containing a number of data values,
     all of which have the same type (like ~int~, ~char~ or ~float~).

   * You can visualize arrays as box collections.

   * The computer stores them differently - sequentially as a set of
     memory addresses.

* One-dimensional arrays

  * The simplest kind of array has one dimension - conceptually
    arranged visually in a single row (or column).

* Declaring arrays

  * To declare an array, we must specify the /type/ and /number/ of its
    elements, e.g. for an array of 10 elements:

    #+begin_src C
      int a[10];           // declare array a of 10 integers
      printf("%d", a[9]);  // print one array element
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 13971188

    - If you run this block repeatedly, you see what the computer
      stores in the respective memory location - random integers

  * The array must be initialized, just like any scalar variable, to
    be of use to us.

  * You can initialize arrays explicitly using ~{...}~:

    #+begin_src C
      int intarray[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
      double doublearray[] = {2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5};
      char chararray[] = {'h','e','l','l','o','\0'};
    #+end_src

    This is how ~chararray~ looks like (the last character ~\0~ is only a
    terminating character):

    #+attr_html: :width 600px

* Array length

  * An array can have any length. Since the length may have to be
    adjusted, it can be useful to define it as a macro with ~#define~.

    #+begin_src C :results silent
      #define N 10
      // ...
      int a[N];
    #+end_src

    - Remember that now ~N~ will be blindly replaced by ~10~ everywhere in
      the program.

* Array subscripting

  * /Subscripting/ or /indexing/ means accessing a particular array
    element.

  * Array elements in C are always numbered starting from 0, so the
    elements of an array of length ~n~ are /indexed/ from ~0~ to ~n-1~.

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    #+caption: Indexing of an 1-dim array 'a' (Source: King)
    [[./img/index.png]]

  * Index expressions ~a[i]~ can be used like other variables:

    #+begin_src C
      int a[10];  // declare array

      a[0] = 1;   // assign value to array element
      a[5] = 2 * 2; // assign operation result to array element

      printf("%d\n", a[5]); // print array element
      printf("%d\n", a[5] - 4);
      printf("%d\n", ++a[0]);
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 4
    : 0
    : 2

* Side effects

  * C does not require that the subscript bounds be checked.

  * If a subscript goes out of bounds, the program's behavior is
    undefined.

  * An array subscript may be an integer expression:
    #+begin_example C
      foo[i+j*10] = 0; // e.g. i=-10, j=1 => foo[0]
      bar[i++];        // e.g. i = -1 => bar[0]
    #+end_example

  * Trace this code:

    #+name: trace
    #+begin_example C
      i = 0;
      while ( i < N )
         a[i++] = 0;
    #+end_example

    - After ~i~ is set to ~0~, the ~while~ statement checks whether ~i~ is
      less than ~N~.
    - If it is, ~0~ is assigned to ~a[i]~, ~i~ is incremented, and the loop
      repeats.
    - Note that ~a[++i]~ would not be right, because ~0~ would be assigned
      to ~a[0]~ during the first loop iteration.

  * Be careful when an array subscript has a side effect. Example: the
    following loop to copy all elements of ~foo~ into ~bar~ may not work
    properly:

    #+name: copy1
    #+begin_example C
      i = 0;
      while (i < N)
        a[i] = b[i++];
    #+end_example

    The statement in the loop accesses the value of ~i~ and modifies
    ~i~. This causes undefined behavior. To do it right, use this code:

    #+name: copy2
    #+begin_example C
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        a[i] = b[i];
    #+end_example

* Iterating over arrays

  * ~for~ loops are made for arrays. Here are a few examples. Can you
    see what each of them does?

    #+name: for_array_1
    #+begin_example C
      for (i = 0; i < 10 ; i++ )
        a[i] = 0;  // initialize a with 0s
    #+end_example

    #+name: for_array_2
    #+begin_example C
      for (i = 0; i < 10 ; i++ )
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    #+end_example

    #+name: for_array_3
    #+begin_example C
      for (i = 0; i < 10 ; i++ )
        sum += a[i];
    #+end_example

* Let's practice!

* Multi-dimensional arrays
** Setup

   * An array may have any number of dimensions.

   * Example: the following array declares a 5 x 9 matrix of 5 rows and
     9 columns.

     #+begin_src C
       int m[5][9]
     #+end_src

     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     #+name: matrix
     #+caption: Matrix indexes in a 2-dim C array (Source: King)
     [[./img/matrix.png]]

** Accessing arrays

   * To access the element in row ~i~ and column ~j~, we must write ~m[i][j]~.

   * To access row ~i~ of ~m~, we write ~m[i]~

   * The expression ~m[i,j]~ is the same as ~m[j]~ (don't use it)

   * C stores arrays not in 2 dim but in row-major order:

     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     #+name: matrix
     #+caption: Row-major memory storage in C (Source: King)
     [[./img/stored.png]]

   * Multi-dimensional arrays play a lesser role in C than in many
     other programming languages because C has a more flexible way to
     store multi-dimensional data, namely /arrays of pointers/.

** Accessing arrays with nested ~for~ loops

   * Nested ~for~ loops are ideal for processing multi-dimensional arrays.

   * Here is the code to initialize a 10x10 /identity/ matrix.

     #+begin_src C :results silent
       #define N 10

       double ident[N][N];
       int row, col;

       for (row = 0; row < N; row++)
         {
           for (col = 0; col < N; col++)
             {
               if (row == col) {
                 ident[row][col] = 1.0;
               } else {
                 ident[row][col] = 0.0;
               }
             }
         }
     #+end_src

   * To initialize an array, you can use brackets as in the 1-dim case.

     #+begin_src C
       int m[3][3] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};

       for (int i=0;i<3;i++) {
         for(int j=0;j<3;j++) {
           printf("%d", m[i][j]);
         }
         printf("\n");
        }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 123
     : 456
     : 789

* The size of arrays

  * The ~sizeof~ operator can determine the size of arrays (in bytes).

  * If ~a~ is an array of ~10~ integers, then ~sizeof(a)~ is 40 provided
    each integer requires 4 bytes of storage[fn:2].

    #+begin_src C
      int a[10] = {0};
      printf("%d", sizeof(a));
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 40

  * You can use the operator also to measure the size of an array
    element: dividing the array size by the element size gives you the
    length of the array:

    #+begin_src C
      int a[10] = {0};
      printf("%d", sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0])); // prints length of array a
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 10

  * You can use this last fact to write a ~for~ loop that goes over the
    whole /length/ of an array - then the array does not have to be
    modified if its length changes.

* Let's practice!

[fn:2]On a 32-bit computer, an ~int~ ranges from -32,768 to 32,767 and
only requires 2 bytes of storage.

[fn:1]The code block is an example of the statistical programming
language R, which is especially strong when it comes to vector
manipulation. ~c()~ is R's concatenation function that chains elements
together to form a vector.
