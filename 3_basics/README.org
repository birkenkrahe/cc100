  * This script summarizes and adds to the treatment by King (2008),
    chapter 2, C Fundamentals - see also [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14qvh00aVb_R09_hrQY0EDEK_JLAkgZ0S/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102963037093118135110&rtpof=true&sd=true][slides (GDrive)]]:

  * You should type along in your own Org-mode file if you can. To
    make this easier, use the auto expansion (~<s~), add the following
    two lines at the top of your file, and activate each line with
    ~C-c C-c~ (you should get a confirmation in the minibuffer):
    #+begin_example
    #+PROPERTY: header-args:C :main yes
    #+PROPERTY: header-args:C :includes <stdio.h>
    #+end_example

  * Remember that ~C-M-\~ inside a code block indents syntactically

  * You will find more class content in the ~agenda.org~ and
    ~notes.org~ files.

** "What a Tangled Web We Weave..."

   #+begin_quote
   "Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive!"
   (Sir Walter Scott, 1808)
   #+end_quote

   In this section, we're once again running code blocks from within
   Org-mode - with a few new literate programming features:

   * To distinguish (and reference) code blocks, we will name them
     (~#+NAME:~). The name can can then be referenced anywhere
   * To turn the code block into a source code C file (~.c~), we will
     add a ~:tangle FILENAME~ statement to the header
   * To create the tangled (source code) file from a block, use the
     keys ~C-c C-v t~ (~org-babel-tangle~)
   * To create the tangled (source code) from a file (all blocks), use
     the keys ~C-c C-v f~ (~org-babel-tangle-file~)
   * Since source code files should have comments, we add the header
     argument ~:comments both~: now, the most recent org block is used
     as a comment
   * The workflow of "tangling" and "weaving"[fn:4] looks like this:

     [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][Learn more about extracting source code from Org files.]]

** Hello World Version 1

   * What happens here:
     - A header file (~stdio.h~) is included for input/output
     - A function (~main~) without arguments (~void~) is defined
     - The function returns integer data (~int~)
     - A string (~"..."~) is printed out
     - A new-line is added at the end (~\n~)
     - If successful, the program returns the value ~0~

   #+NAME: hello1
   #+begin_src C :exports both :tangle ./src/hello1.c :comments both
     #include <stdio.h>
     int main(void)
     {
       printf("Hello world\n");
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS: hello1
   : Hello world

** Hello World Version 2

   The program could also have been written much simpler:
   * This function ~main~ is missing the ~void~ argument, and the
     ~int~ (indicating the type of variable returned - an integer).
   * Alas, in Org-mode, this program will not compile, though outside
     of Org-mode, it will (with a warning). Try it!

   #+NAME: hello2
   #+begin_src C :exports both :tangle ./src/hello2.c :comments both
     #include <stdio.h>
     main()
     {
       printf("Hello world\n");
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS: hello2

** Hello World Version 3

   The program could also have been written more complicated:
   - ~int argc~ is an integer, or single number - the number of
     arguments that were passed to ~main~
   - ~char **argv~ (or ~char *argv[]~) is a pointer that refers to an
     array of characters - a more complicated data structure.

   #+NAME: hello3
   #+begin_src C :exports both :tangle ./src/hello3.c :comments both
     #include <stdio.h>

     int main(int argc, char **argv)
     {
       printf("hello world\n");
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src


   #+RESULTS: hello3
   : hello world

* Compiler workflow

  The machine cannot process ~pun.c~ without help. It must

  |------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Preprocess | The preprocessor acts on lines beginning with ~#~             |
  |------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Compile    | The compiler translates instructions into object code         |
  |------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Link       | The linker combines object code and functions like ~printf()~ |
  |------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Run        | The final ~*.exe~ program is a binary (machine) program       |
  |------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Debug      | The debugger controls rule violations along the way           |
  |------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|

  I compiled the ~hello.c~ program on a Linux box - the executable is
  called ~hello.out~. Compare the two executables - what do you
  notice?

  [[./img/files.png]]

  | Challenge: are these executables portable?[fn:3] |

* Shell execution

  * You can also save the code in a program ~pun.c~
  * Compile it on the Windows command line or in the Emacs shell:

    | COMMAND            | ACTION                                        |
    |--------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
    | C-x C-f pun.c      | Create C file ~pun.c~                         |
    |                    | Copy block or write code anew in ~pun.c~      |
    | C-x C-s            | Save ~pun.c~                                  |
    | M-x eshell         | start a command line shell in an Emacs buffer |
    | ~gcc -o pun pun.c~ | compile program and create executable         |
    | ~ls~               | list files - you should see ~pun.exe~         |
    | ~pun~              | execute program                               |

    * The shell is an Emacs Lisp simulation of a Linux shell (~bash~)
    * Windows ~PowerShell~ would also work (run with ~./pun[.exe]~)

* Syntax highlighting

  * Notice the slight syntax highlighting difference to ~repl.it~

    #+attr_html: :width 330px
    [[./img/replit.png]]

  * There is no highlighting standard - you should experiment with
    different themes[fn:1]

  * Display line numbers with ~display-line-numbers-mode~, and
    highlight lines with ~hl-line-mode~[fn:2]:

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/pun.png]]

* Comments

  Forgetting to terminate a comment may cause the compiler to ignore
  part of your program - but both syntax highlighting and auto-indent
  in the editor will tip you off:

  #+begin_src C :exports both :main yes :includes stdio.h

    printf("My "); /* forgot to close this comment ...
                      printf("cat ");
                      printf("has ");  /* so it ends here */
    printf("fleas");

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : My fleas

  Let's fix this:

  #+begin_src C :exports both :main yes :includes stdio.h

    printf("My "); /* forgot to close this comment */
    printf("cat ");
    printf("has ");  /* so it ends here */
    printf("fleas");

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : My cat has fleas

* Variable types and declarations

  * C computes using placeholders, or *variables*

  * Each variable must have a *type* to specify the data it can hold

  * E.g. ~int~ (integer), ~float~ (floating point), ~char~ (character)

  * Variables must be *declared* before they can be used, see [[type
    declaration examples]]
    #+name: type declaration examples
    #+begin_src C :results silent
      int height;
      float profit;
      char name;
    #+end_src

  * Several variables of the same type can be declared together:
    #+name: type declaration examples 1
    #+begin_src C :results silent
      int height, length, width, volume;
      float profit, loss;
      char first_name, last_name;
    #+end_src

  * Variable type declarations must precede statements that use the
    variables

  * The block with *declarations* comes before the statements[fn:1]

* Variable assignment

  * A variable gets its value through *assignment*

  * In [[assignment example 1]], the variable ~height~ gets the value
    ~8~[fn:4]
    #+name: assignment example 1
    #+begin_src C
      height = 8;
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: assignment example 1

  * [X] If you tried to run [[assignment example 1]], you got an
    error. Can you see why?[fn:2]

  * [X] However, [[assignment example 2]] throws another error. What's
    wrong this time?[fn:3]
    #+name: assignment example 2
    #+begin_src C
      height = 8;
      int height;
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: assignment example 2

  * Code block [[assignment example fixed]] works.
    #+name: assignment example fixed
    #+begin_src C :results silent
      int height;
      height = 8;
    #+end_src

  * A constant assigned to a ~float~ variable contains a decimal point
    and the letter ~f~, as shown in [[float point]].
    #+name: float point
    #+begin_src C :results silent
      float profit;
      profit = 2150.48f;
    #+end_src

  * Assigning a ~float~ to an ~int~ and vice versa is possible but not
    safe.

  * Variables with values can be used to compute other values, as
    shown in [[compute value]].
    #+name: compute value
    #+begin_src C :results silent
      int height, length, width, volume;

      height = 8;
      length = 12;
      width = 10;
      volume = height * length * width;
    #+end_src

  * You can also initiate and declare variables at once. In [[initiate]],
    the ~volume~ from before is computed inside ~printf~.
    #+name: initiate
    #+begin_src C
      int height = 8, length = 12, width = 10;

      printf("Volume: %d", height * length * width);
    #+end_src

  * To print these variables, we need to learn *formatting*

* Formatting printout
** ~printf~ vs. ~puts~

   * We use the built-in (via ~stdio.h~) function ~printf~ to print.

   * We also used ~puts~ in the past, which includes the newline
     character ~\n~ that we need to add for ~printf~[fn:7].

** Formatting integer numbers

   * In the code [[int print]], ~%d~ is a placeholder for an ~int~:
     #+name: int print
     #+begin_src C
       int height;  // type declaration
       height = 8;  // variable assignment

       printf("The height is: %d\n", height); // formatted printout
     #+end_src

** Formatting floating point numbers

   * In [[float print]], ~%f~ is used to print a ~float~:
     #+name: float print
     #+begin_src C
       float profit;       // type declaration
       profit = 2150.48f;  // variable assignment

       printf("The profit is: $%f\n", profit); // formatted printout
     #+end_src

** Change floating point precision

   * By default, ~%f~ displays the result with six digits. To change
     it to ~p~ digits, put ~.p~ between ~%~ and ~f~. E.g. to print it
     with 2 digits, ~p=2~:
     #+name: p digits
     #+begin_src C
       float profit;       // type declaration
       profit = 2150.48f;  // variable assignment

       printf("The profit is: $%.2f\n", profit); // formatted printout
     #+end_src

** Formatting errors

   * What happens when you get the formatting wrong?  in [[format_test]],
     we print a ~float~ first correctly, then with the wrong format
     identifier, and then the other way around.
     #+name: format_test
     #+begin_src C
       float foo;  // defined float
       foo = 3.14f;   // assigned float
       printf("%.2f\n",foo);  // formatted float as float
       printf("%d\n",foo);  // formatted float as int

       int bar;  // defined int
       bar = 314;   // assigned int
       printf("%d\n",bar);  // formatted int as int
       printf("%.2f\n",bar);  // formatted int as float
     #+end_src

* Putting it all together (C program)

  * Shipping fees are based on volume instead of weight. For the
    conversion, the volume is divided by 166. If the result exceeds
    the actual weight, the shipping fee is based on the "dimensional
    weight"[fn:5].

  * [X] We write a program to compute the dimensional ~weight~ of a box of
    given ~volume~ - we use ~/~ for division. Let's say the box is
    12'' x 10'' x 8 ''. What does [[box_error]] need to run?
    #+name: box_error
    #+begin_src C
      volume = 12 * 10 * 8
        height = volume / 166
    #+end_src

  * [X] Fixed the errors in [[box]]. The compiler no longer complains, but
    we don't see anything. How can we print the result?
    #+name: box
    #+begin_src C
      int weight, volume;
      volume = 12 * 10 * 8;
      weight = volume / 166;
    #+end_src

  * [X] The code in [[box_print]] prints the result of the computation.
    #+name: box_print
    #+begin_src C
      int weight, volume;     // declare variable types
      volume = 12 * 10 * 8;   // compute value
      weight = volume / 166;  // assign and compute values
      printf("The dimensional weight is %d\n",weight); // print result
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: box_print
    : The dimensional weight is 5

  * This is not what we need. When dividing one integer by another, C
    "truncates" the answer - the result is rounded down, but the
    shipping company wants us to round up. This can be achieved by
    adding 165 to the volume before dividing by 166[fn:6] as shown in
    [[dweight]].
    #+name: dweight
    #+begin_src C
      int weight, volume;     // declare variable types
      volume = 12 * 10 * 8;   // compute value
      weight = (volume + 165) / 166;  // assign and compute values
      printf("The dimensional weight is %d\n",weight); // print result
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: dweight
    : The dimensional weight is 6

  * [X] Now for the final program [[dweight_c]]. This time, we allow for
    tangling the program as ~dweight.c~.
    #+name: dweight_c
    #+begin_src C :tangle dweight.c :results raw
      #include <stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
        // declare variable types
        int height, length, width, volume, weight;

        // variable assignments
        height = 8;
        length = 12;
        width = 10;
        volume = height * length * width;
        weight = (volume + 165) / 166;

        // print results
        printf("Dimensions: %dx%dx%d\n", length, width, height);
        printf("Volume (cubic inches): %d\n", volume);
        printf("Dimensional weight (pounds): %d\n", weight);

        return 0;
      }
    #+end_src

* Constants
** Macro definition with ~#define~

   * If I don't want a value to change, I define a ~consatnt~. There
     are different ways of doing that. The code in [[define]] shows a
     declarative constant definition for the pre-processor that
     blindly substitutes the value everywhere in the program. This is
     also called a *macro definition*.
     #+name: define
     #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
       #define PI 3.141593
       printf("PI is %f\n",PI);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: define
     : PI is 3.141593

   * So if I mistype my definition, I get errors. Take [[constant]] and
     introduce an error: in [[constant_err_1]], ~= 3.141593~ is substituted
     for ~PI~ everywhere - the program will not compile.
     #+name: constant_err_1
     #+begin_src C :results silent
       #define PI = 3.141593
       printf("PI is %f\n",PI);
     #+end_src

   * [X] Can you see what went wrong in [[constant_err_2]] ? If you don't
     see it at once, check the compiler error output!
     #+name: constant_err_2
     #+begin_src C :results silent
       #define PI 3.141593;
       printf("PI is %f\n",PI);
     #+end_src

   * It's easy to make mistakes with user-defined constants. Constants
     declared with ~#define~ can be redefined.

   * [ ] Write a program that demonstrates how a constant declared
     with ~#define~ can be redefined later with a second ~#define~
     declaration.
     #+name: redefined
     #+begin_src C
       #define WERT 1.0
       printf("Constant is %.2f\n", WERT);

       #define WERT 2.0
       printf("Constant is %.2f\n", WERT);
     #+end_src

** Library definitions with ~#include~

   * Since mathematical constants are so important in scientific
     computing, there is a library that contains them, ~math.h~. In
     [[math]], it is included at the start to give us the value of Pi as
     the constant ~M_PI~ with much greater precision than before.
     #+name: math
     #+begin_src C :includes <math.h>
       printf("PI is %f\n",M_PI);
       printf("PI is %.18f\n",M_PI);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: math
     : PI is 3.141593
     : PI is 3.141592653589793116

   * If you write source code outside of Emacs Org-mode, you have to
     include this library file explicitly like this:
     #+begin_example
       #include <math.h>
     #+end_example

   * Here is more information on [[https://www.w3schools.in/c-tutorial/c-header-files/][C header files]] and on how ~#include~
     works.

   * In Linux, ~math.h~ and the other header files sit in
     ~/usr/include/~. The screenshot shows the math constant section
     of ~math.h~.
     #+caption: Mathematical constants in /usr/include/math.h
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     [[./img/math.png]]

   * [ ] Where is ~math.h~ in Windows? Where in MacOS? Find the file,
     open and look at it in Emacs (the file is read-only).

** Type definition with ~const~

   * Modern C has the ~const~ identifier to protect constants. [[const]]
     shows an example. Here, ~double~ is a higher precision floating
     point number type.
     #+name: const
     #+begin_src C
       const double TAXRATE_CONST = 0.175f;
       double revenue = 200.0f;
       double tax;

       tax = revenue * TAXRATE_CONST;

       printf("Tax on revenue %.2f is %.2f", revenue, tax);
     #+end_src

   * [ ] What happens if you try to redefine the constant ~taxrate~
     after the type declaration? Modify [[const]] accordingly and run it.
     #+name: const_err
     #+begin_src C :results silent
       const double TAXRATE_CONST = 0.175f;
       double revenue = 200.0f;
       double tax;

       TAXRATE_CONST = 0.2f;
       tax = revenue * TAXRATE_CONST;

       printf("Tax on revenue %.2f is %.2f", revenue, tax);
     #+end_src

* Naming identifiers

** Naming conventions

   (The code blocks in this section are all silent - will give no
   output - but because they're only snippets, they will not compile.)

   * Use upper case letters for CONSTANTS
     #+begin_src C :results silent
       const double TAXRATE;
     #+end_src

   * Use lower case letters for variables
     #+begin_src C :results silent
       int tax;
     #+end_src

   * Use lower case letters for function names
     #+begin_src C :results silent
       hello();
     #+end_src

   * If names consist of more than one word, separate with ~_~ or
     insert capital letters:
     #+begin_src C :results silent
       hello_world();
       helloWorld();
     #+end_src

   * Name according to function! In [[naming_example]], both functions are
     identical from the point of view of the compiler, but one can be
     understood, the other one cannot.
     #+name: naming_example
     #+begin_src C :results silent
       const int SERVICE_CHARGE;
       int v;

       int myfunc(int z) {
         int t;
         t = z + v;
         return t;
       }

       int calculate_grand_total(int subtotal) {
         int grand_total;
         grand_total = subtotal + SERVICE_CHARGE;
         return grand_total;
       }
     #+end_src

** Naming rules

   * What about rules? The compiler will tell you if one of your names
     is a mistake! However, why waste the time, and the rules are
     interesting, too, at least syntactically, to a nerd.

   * Names are sensitive towards spelling and capitalization:
     ~helloWorld~ is different from ~HELLOWORLD~ or
     ~Helloworld~. Confusingly, you could use all three in the same
     program, and the compiler would distinguish them.

   * Names cannot begin with a number, and they may not contain
     dashes/minus signs. These are all illegal:
     #+begin_example
       10times  get-net-char 
     #+end_example
     These are good:
     #+begin_example
     times10    get_next_char
     #+end_example

   * There is no limit to the length of an identifier, so this name,
     presumably by a German programmer, is okay:
     #+begin_example
     Voreingenommenheit_bedeutet_bias_auf_Deutsch
     #+end_example

   * The keywords in the table have special significance to the
     compiler and cannot be used as identifiers:

     | auto       | enum    | restrict | unsigned | break  | extern   |
     | return     | void    | case     | float    | short  | volatile |
     | char       | for     | signed   | while    | const  | goto     |
     | sizeof     | _Bool   | continue | if       | static | _Complex |
     | _Imaginary | default | union    | struct   | do     | int      |
     | switch     | double  | long     | typedef  | else   | register |

   * Your turn: name some illegal identifiers and see what the
     compiler says!

** TODO Practice: which of these names are not allowed?

* IN PROGRESS Program Layout

  * You can think of a program statement as a series of tokens:

  * You can have any amount of white (empty) space between program tokens

  * You can divide statements over any number of lines

  * Space between tokens makes identification easier

  * Indentation makes nesting easier to spot

  * Blank lines can divide a program into logical units

  * C keywords must remain undivided

** TODO Practice: improve the layout!

[fn:7][[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puts-vs-printf-for-printing-a-string/][See here]] for a comparison of ~printf()~ vs. ~puts()~.

[fn:6]165/166 is 0.9939759, so we've just messed with the actual
volume.

[fn:5]
#+begin_quote
"Cargo space has physical limits based on the volume of the cargo and
the weight. The reason why both volume & weight are evaluated can be
better understood if you consider the cost of shipping a large object
with less weight.

For example, a large box containing styrofoam cups weighs very less,
i.e., the dimensional (volume) weight of that box will likely be more
than its actual weight. It is for this reason that most airlines and
other transport providers evaluate both dimensional weight & actual
weight, and then use the greater of the two weights to bill you for
the transportation costs. The greater of the two weights is also
commonly referred to as ‘chargeable weight’." ([[unirelo][UniRelo, 2020]])

[fn:4]The value ~8~ is called a ~constant~ because it cannot change

[fn:3]The declaration must precede the use of the variable.

[fn:2]Assignment is variable use. Variable types must be declared
before they can be used.

[fn:1]In the C99 standard, declarations don't have to come before
statements.

* Concept summary

  * C programs must be compiled and linked
  * Programs consist of directives, functions, and statements
  * C directives begin with a hash mark (~#~)
  * C statements end with a semicolon (~;~)
  * C functions begin and end with parentheses ~{~ and ~}~

[fn:4] In our case, instead of weaving TeX files (~.tex~) to print, we
weave Markdown files (~.md~), or WORD (~*.odt~) files, or we dispense
with the weaving altogether because Org-mode files (equivalent of the
~*.w~ or "web" files) look fine on GitHub.
GitHub.

[fn:3]Executables are the result of compilation for a specific
computer architecture and OS. The ~.exe~ program was compiled for
Windows, the ~.out~ program was compiled for Linux. They will only run
on these OS.

[fn:1]You can find [[https://emacsthemes.com/][themes for GNU Emacs]] here, and install them
using ~M-x package-list-packages~.

[fn:2]If you always want to have line numbers and highlight the line
under the cursor, put these lines in your ~.emacs~ file: and restart
Emacs:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; always display line numbers
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode)
  ;; enable global highlighting
  (global-hl-line-mode 1)
#+end_src
